<h1>Framework, Arch and Kernel Update</h1>
<p>
I bought a Framework laptop a couple of months back, and installed Arch Linux on it, btw.
For some reason, kernel update made the whole system crash, and I had to rollback.
I thought it was some driver issues, but turned out it was not!
Everything is so much easier than I thought.
</p>

<p>
I am using LUKS to encrypt my drive.
In this setup <tt>/boot</tt> is a part of the <tt>/root</tt> partition that is encrypted.
A separate EFI partition and /boot/loader content is not mounted when I am logged in the system.
When I updated the system with <tt>pacman -Syu</tt>, the /boot/loader was not there, and bootctl did not update the kernel.
I found this today because <tt>uname -r</tt> returned an old kernel version.
This made the whole thing go to hell.
</p>

<p>
The solution is obvious now, I just had to mount this part of the <tt>/boot</tt> by <tt>sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /boot</tt> and run <tt>pacman -Syu</tt> after that.
