    "\n",
    "*[Slides](http://videolectures.net/site/normal_dl/tag=1137927/deeplearning2017_pineau_reinforcement_learning_01.pdf)* |*[Video](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2017_pineau_reinforcement_learning/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The best introduction to RL I have seen so far. Heavily recommended. Even if you already know some stuff, it will be useful for you to have a more or less whole picture of the basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a short introduction, Joelle Pineau mentions the recent applications of RL found in [RLDM 2017](http://rldm.org/rldm2017/) submissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* robotics\n",
    "* video games\n",
    "* conversational systems\n",
    "* medical intervention (x_X)\n",
    "* algorithm improvement\n",
    "* improvisational theater\n",
    "* autonomous driving\n",
    "* prosthetic arm control\n",
    "* financial trading\n",
    "* query completion\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the list is really large. And this is only after looking through half of the accepted papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture proceeds with the question \"When should I apply RL to my problem\".\n",
    "The answer is the combination of the following prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "* your data comes in the form of trajectories (forget about the i.i.d. assumption);\n",
    "* your system needs some kind of intervention;\n",
    "* you need feedback in order to understand if you are doing well or not\n",
    "* your problem is the one requiring both learning and planning\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecturer mentions, that RL is somehow similar to Supervised Learning, but not completely.\n",
    "There are some challenges, both practical and technical:\n",
    "\n",
    "* need some environment to operate in (one of the reasons for slow progress of RL in the past)\n",
    "* you need to learn and plan at the same time using correlated samples\n",
    "* your data distribution changes along with your learning procedure (the actions you take bring an agent to different states, and it makes the learning harder)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, Joelle gives the formal representation of an RL problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), defined as a tuple $\\langle S,A,T(s,a,s'), R(s,a), \\mu(s) \\rangle$, where $S$ is the set of states, $A$ is the set of actions, $T(s,a,s')$ is the transition function returning the distribution over the next states $s'$ given the current state $s$ and the action taken $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "M in MDP stands for 'Markov', i.e. the process holds the Markov assumption: the future is independent of the past given the future. What does it mean? Our next state depends only on the current one, we do not need to know the whole history of states in order to predict the future.\n",
    "And the definition of the *state* according to Joelle is the following. A *state* is a sufficient amount of information about the world in order to predict the future.\n",
    "Sometimes in the real life, the assumption does not hold, that's true. But RL still uses it in order to reduce the complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the goal of RL? We want to maximize the reward we get for our interaction with the environment.\n",
    "We can have two options here, either the task at hand is episodic (e.g. a game episode ends when you win or lose) or continuous (e.g. balancing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the future reward flow is discounted by the coefficient $\\gamma \\in [0,1)$ (usually close to 1.\n",
    "$\\gamma$ helps to trade off the balance between preferences in the immediate reward and the future reward.\n",
    "It is often said, that we discount the reward flow due to psychological reasons: humans prefer the immediate reward to the future reward.\n",
    "But, as Joelle mentions, it is much more mathematically convenient to use the discounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now go to one of the most important definitions in RL -- policy function. \n",
    "Policy $\\pi$ is a function, that returns an action given the state: $\\pi(s,a) = p(a_t = a | s_t = s)$.\n",
    "And to solve an RL problem is to find a policy which maximizes the expected future reward flow: $argmax_{\\pi} E_{\\pi} [r_0 + r_1 + ... + r_T | s_0]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function of a state is an expected return of a policy starting from this particular state: $V_{\\pi}(s) = E_{\\pi} [r_t + r_{t+1} + ... + r_T | s_t = s]$.\n",
    "I don't get why, but all the definitions are given without the discounting. \n",
    "Maybe it does not matter here since when we take expectations later, we will be able to keep the gammas outside of the expectations, but I'm not sure. At Sutton & Barto's book, all the definitions and derivations are given for the discounted return. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order not to mess all the terms and definitions, the lecturer gives the following slide:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reward is a one-step numerical feedback\n",
    "* Return is the sum of rewards of the agent's trajectory\n",
    "* Value is the expected sum of rewards over the agent's trajectory\n",
    "* Utility is the numerical function representing preferences (in RL *return* $\\equiv$ *utility*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let's go to the policy evaluation. What is the value of a policy? It is just the expected immediate reward plus the expected future reward: \n",
    "$V_{\\pi}(s) = E_{\\pi}[r_t + r_{t+1} + ... + r_T | s_t = s] = E_{\\pi}[r_t] + E_{\\pi}[r_{t+1} + ... + r_{T} | s_t = s]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's rewrite the expectations now: \n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a \\in A}\\pi(s,a)R(s,a) + E_{\\pi}[r_{t+1} + ... + r_T | s_t = s]$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a \\in A}\\pi(s,a)R(s,a) + \\sum_{a \\in A}\\pi(s,a)\\sum_{s' \\in S}T(s,a,s')E_{\\pi}[r_{t+1} + ... + r_T | s_{t+1} = s']$ \n",
    "\n",
    "And, looking at the definition of value function, we can see, that the the last expecation on the right hand side is just the value function of the state $s'$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a \\in A}\\pi(s,a)R(s,a) + \\sum_{a \\in A}\\pi(s,a)\\sum_{s' \\in S}T(s,a,s')V_{\\pi}(s')$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we can see, that this is a dynamic programming algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecturer uses the formulas with discounting now:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{\\pi}(s) = \\sum_{a \\in A}\\pi(s,a)[R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum_{s' \\in S}T(s,a,s')V_{\\pi}(s')]$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to write the equation for the state-action value function $Q$ -- the function, returning the value of a state given that we take the particular action first and then follow the policy $\\pi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_{\\pi}(s,a) = R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum_{s' \\in S}\\big[T(s,a,s')\\sum_{a' \\in A}[\\pi(s',a')Q_{\\pi}(s',a')]\\big]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two formulas are the two forms of Bellman's equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rewrite the first one in the matrix form $V_{\\pi} = R_{\\pi} + \\gamma T_{\\pi}V_{\\pi}$.\n",
    "It has the unique solution $V_{\\pi} = (I - \\gamma T_{\\pi})^{-1}R_{\\pi}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now assume, that we have the fixed policy, how can we evaluate it? \n",
    "Let's somehow initialize the value function $V_{\\pi}$ (with zeroes, for instance). \n",
    "On each iteration, we update the value function for each state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{k+1}(s) \\leftarrow (R(s,\\pi(s)) + \\gamma \\sum_{s' \\in S}T(s,\\pi(s), s')V_k(s')$, where $k$ is the index of the iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat it until the value function does not update anymore or the number of updates is no more than some threshold. \n",
    "There is the derivation of convergence in the slides (slide #31), but I will not write it here. I will just say, that it uses the fact, that $\\gamma < 0$ to show, that\n",
    "the norm between the current approximation and the true value function contracts to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "We move from the fixed policy to finding the best (optimal) policy.\n",
    "The optimal value function is the highers return we can get from the state: $V^{*}(s) = max_{\\pi}V_{\\pi}(s)$. \n",
    "A policy, that achieves $V^{*}$ is called an *optimal policy* $\\pi^*$.\n",
    "For each MDP there is a unique optimal value function. **BUT** the optimal policy is not necessarily unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a solution to an MDP means having either the optimal value function $V^*$ or an optimal policy $\\pi^*$.\n",
    "We are saying that since if we have one of them, we can derive the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already looked at the policy evaluation algorithm for a fixed policy. But how to find the best policy? There are two related algorithms: policy iteration and value iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Policy iteration goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* initialize a policy somehow, random is also possible\n",
    "* Repeat\n",
    "  * Compute $V_{\\pi}$ using Policy Evaluation algorithm\n",
    "  * Compute $\\pi'$ that is greedy with respect to $V_{\\pi}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "* terminate when $\\pi = \\pi'$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A the value iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "* initialize the value function $V_0(s)$\n",
    "* each iteration do the update $V_{k+1}(s) = max_{a \\in A}(R(s,a) + \\gamma \\sum_{s' \\in S}T(s,a,s')V_k(s'))$\n",
    "* stop when the value function changes for a step is below some threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexities of the algorithms are the following ($S$ is the state space size, $A$ is the action space size):\n",
    "\n",
    "* policy evaluation: $O(s)^3$\n",
    "* policy iteration: $O(S^3 + S^2A)$ per iteration\n",
    "* value iteration: $O(S^2A)$ per iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an example in the slides, but I will not put it here, but it's important to go through it if you think, you're confused about all the said above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from the complexities, that the algorithms get less and less feasible as our state-action space scales, however, we can try not to update all the states in value iteration, but only the important ones. \n",
    "Moreover, we can do the asynchronous updates, generating trajectories through the MDP and update the states only when they appear on a trajectory. In policy iteration, we are not forced to do one policy update after each policy evaluation. We can combine the updates and evaluations in any combination we find appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those, who do not want to read the slides and watch the lectures anymore, but want to do the hardcore research, Joelle has the 'challenges' slide. I will also put them in a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Designing the problem domain\n",
    "  * state representation\n",
    "  * action choice\n",
    "  * cost/reward signal\n",
    "* acquiring data for training\n",
    "  * exploration/exploitation\n",
    "  * high cost actions\n",
    "  * time-delayed cost/reward signal\n",
    "* function approximation\n",
    "* validation/confidence measures\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture proceeds with describing on-line learning, which can be of two types, according to the lecturer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monte-Carlo estimate, when we use the empirical return $U(s_t)$ as a target estimate for the actual value function: $V(s_t) = V(s_t) + \\alpha(U(s_t) - V(s_t)$\n",
    "* Temporal-Difference (TD) learning: $V(s_t) = V(s_t) + \\alpha [r_{t+1} + \\gamma V(s_{t+1} - V(s_t)] \\forall t = 0,1,2,...$\n",
    "\n",
    "As Joelle mentions, online learning is highly unstable, and a lot of recent RL research focused on improving the stability of the online learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, the lecture assumed, we are in a tabular setup when the value function and the policy can be represented as a large table. But in the real world, this approach will never work since the problems are much harder. \n",
    "We need to use the function approximations.\n",
    "Linear functions have been used for a long time. \n",
    "Recently, using neural nets as function approximators has become very popular, and we can use all the Deep Learning progress within RL, e.g. memory augmented models [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture continues with describing the on-policy/off-policy dichotomy in RL. \n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, each policy change leads to data distribution change, so, when we evaluate several policies within the same batch, we need a large batch of data and a policy which adequately covers all (s,a) combinations. \n",
    "One of the solutions to the problem is to use importance sampling attaching different weights do data collected from different policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration/exploitation dilemma goes next.\n",
    "You've definitely heard about it. \n",
    "When you have some policy, you might follow it and get your deserved return or you can try something new to achieve, possibly, more. \n",
    "Though researchers have been trying to solve the problem for a long time, it is still far from being solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, Joelle mentions the two approaches to RL: model-based and model-free. The first tries to learn the model of the environment first and do the planning later. The second, that is more successful recently, is trying to learn a policy directly using the data from the environment. As for me, I find model-based approach very cool, but it is harder to learn. It has not been so hot recently, but the research is going on and, I hope, we will see great results in the near future. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was also an interesting question from the audience about choosing the discounting coefficient $\\gamma$. \n",
    "Joelle says that before she thought, that choosing the gamma is the problem of one who chooses the domain and creates the environment.\n",
    "But the community moves further and further to the fact, that $\\gamma$ is a hyperparameter and, maybe, we should be more aggressive at the beginning of the training when our estimations are too noisy. \n",
    "There were no literature pointers in the lecture, but I wrote an email, and Joelle sent me the link [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture is over, if you want to know more, either continue to read or find more awesome resources [here]( https://github.com/aikorea/awesome-rl).\n",
    "As for me, I want to add, that the lecture is great not only because of summarizing the basics of RL, but also giving some intuitions which help to understand the concepts better. "

    "And *prediction learning* is something that does scale.\n",

    "Why do you need TD learning? When your problem is a multi-step prediction problem $\\rightarrow$ something which supervised learning is not really great in, e.g. stock price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not treat the problem above as step-by-step prediction? Rich says it's a trap and mentions POMDPs, Bayesians, control theory and compression enthusiasts x_X. Long-term predictions are hard and small errors are amplified.\n",

I don't get the general message apart from Nando de Freitas bringing our attention to learning physics, using language in RL, imitation learning and transfer. Maybe that was the idea: to have a look at the most interesting topics which are under heavy research right now. For those who got interested, the talk has a lot of references as well.

    "\n",
    "### Why and what\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should we care about theory?\n",
    "Here, by theory, we mean models + predictions (i.e. convergence properties).\n",
    "Theory helps us to design algorithms, understand their behaviour, quantify knowledge/uncertainty, and identify new/refine old challenges.\n",
    "Theory also might help you to explain why something doesn't work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Csaba introduces the learning theory framework with all the notation needed.\n",
    "Actually, it's not that heavily used throughout the lecture, but it's interesting to put it anyway so that we are aware of the setting we are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are in the realm of binary classification.\n",
    "$X \\in \\mathcal{R}^d$ is the input space, $Y \\in {0,1}$ is the output space.\n",
    "We have distributions $\\mathcal{P} \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}(X \\times Y)$, where $\\mathcal{M}(S)$ means all the distributions over the set $S$.\n",
    "We generate iid samples $(X_1, Y_1) ... (X_n, Y_n)$, where $(X_i, Y_i) \\sim P \\in \\mathcal{P}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next ingredient in learning theory are predictors (hypotheses) $h: X \\rightarrow Y$ for the data we haven't seen.\n",
    "We also need to define a loss $l: \\mathcal{H} \\times (X \\times Y) \\rightarrow [0, \\infty]$\n",
    "Finally, a learning algorithm maps samples to hypotheses $(X \\times Y)^n \\rightarrow \\mathcal{H}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk of the predictor $R(h)$ shows how bad our predictor is: $R(h, P) = p(h(X) \\neq Y), where (X,Y) \\sim P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can split the questions learning theory deals with into two main groups: a priori (\"how well our algorithm performs on new data?\") and a posteriori (\"how well is the algorithm doing on some data\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental theorem of statistical learning theory (SLT) says the following: in binary classification, to match the loss of best hypothesis in class $\\mathcal{H}$ up to accuracy $\\epsilon$, one needs $\\widetilde{\\theta}(\\mathop{VC}(\\mathcal{H})/\\epsilon^2)$ observations.\n",
    "VC dimension is not defined here.\n",
    "Personally, I like how it's explained in [Learning from Data](https://www.work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) course from Caltech.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational complexity of learning linear classifiers is the next important result of SLT presented in the talk:\n",
    "*Unless $\\mathop{NP}={RP}$, linear classifiers (hyperplanes!) cannot be learned in polynomial-time.*\n",
    "$\\mathop{RP}$ is randomised-time polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch learning\n",
    "\n",
    "We are in the MDP framework.\n",
    "Somebody is collecting the data for us (to make it closer to the supervised learning scenario): $(X_t, A_t, Y_t, R_t), t \\in [1, N]$, the samples are iid.\n",
    "We need to find an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy in $\\Pi$.\n",
    "If horizon $H=0$, we just want to maximise the immediate reward.\n",
    "Batch RL is at least as hard as cost-sensitive classification (CSS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at one particular instance of an RL problem.\n",
    "The horizon $H=2$.\n",
    "The state space $S = \\{0,1\\}$.\n",
    "The policy $\\pi$ is a function of a threshold $\\theta$: $\\pi(x, \\theta) = \\mathop{sgn}(x-\\theta), \\theta \\in [0,1]$.\n",
    "The MDP is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "* if you start at 0, your state is 0\n",
    "* if you start at 1, your state is 1\n",
    "* if you start at anywhere but at 0,1 or 0.5, you transition to 0.5\n",
    "* if you at 0.5 and you take 1, you end up at 1, if you take 0, you end at 0\n",
    "* the initial states are generated from the uniform distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "There might be two MDPs with different rewards:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0 state is a good state (+1) and 1 is a bad state(-1)\n",
    "* another way round\n",
    "\n",
    "The catch is that 0.5 is of utmost importance for the solution, but we don't encounter 0.5 in the $s \\rightarrow s'$ transitions where s=0.5 (horizon is 2). Hence, the sample complexity of batch RL is infinite!\n",
    "\n",
    "### When you have a simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a simulator, things are much easier.\n",
    "Or are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitions and reward might be either deterministic or stochastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a (huge) MDP we either need to compute a good policy from $\\Pi$ or a good action at a given state of a good policy from $\\Pi$. \n",
    "It's not that easy to answer which one is easier, but ... spoilers ... the second one is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Csaba introduces Fitted Value Iteration next, where for each training epoch we try to solve a regression problem to approximate the value function. \n",
    "The target variables are fixed for an epoch.\n",
    "Now we have another problem: instability [29]: sometimes it work, sometimes it doesn't. \n",
    "The point of the theory is to find out *why* it doesn't work sometimes and what is important to make it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why the hell DQN worked?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The initial distribution of states is not fixed, but slowly changes (experience replay).\n",
    "* 'right' bias using CNNs\n",
    "* better fit of data and better bias both explained by theory (???)\n",
    "\n",
    "### No simulator, 'learning' in the real world (have a reward signal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we care about online RL?\n",
    "An alternative is to build a model of the environment, but that's pretty hard and poor models might lead to poor policy learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration is a hard and important problem in RL. \n",
    "Csaba gives an example when random exploration is horrible: you can either do nothing (you will move backwards in this case), or take an action which will either move you forward with the probability of 0.5 or will put you in the same place.\n",
    "The reward is in the leftmost position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bandits are an RL problem with a single state.\n",
    "Exploration is studied often in the bandit setting.\n",
    "To know more about bandits and exploration (UCB is the best), go to [http://banditalgs.com](http://banditalgs.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "For MDPs, $R_T = \\Omega(\\sqrt{DSAT})$, where $R_T$ is the total regret and $D$ is the diameter: maximum of best travel times between pairs of states.\n",
    "Why do we, again, care?\n",
    "All this stuff that shows up in the complexity might affect your performance.\n",
    "You need to start making assumptions to make it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I expected this to be a horrifying lecture full of derivations and notation.\n",
    "But it turned out to be a really fun and interesting high-level talk with motivations for using theory in research.\n",

    "Intrinsic reward is the reward we get for a surprise, an error in prediction of a salient event according to the option model.\n",
    "Any time you encounter a salient event, you create an option for it (a behaviour model and a prediction model) which you update during agent life.\n",
    "An agent learns new skills using a model-based approach (e.g. DYNA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine, but where do rewards come from?\n",
    "Usually, in RL, we get the reward (also a problem if you apply RL in the real life though). \n",

    "Let's assume that there is an agent designer who has preferences, his implicit reward function.\n",
    "An agent also has a reward function hardcoded by the designer.\n",
    "In RL these both rewards are confounded.\n",
    "How can we design a reward so that when agent maximises its own reward, the designer's reward is maximised as well? We call this problem the 'optimal reward problem':\n",
    "$\\mathop{argmax}_{R_i}\\mathbb{E}_{env}[\\mathbb{E}_{h}[U_o(h)]]$, where $h$ is the trajectory, $R_i$ is the agent's internal reward, $U_o$ is the designer utility of the trajectory (sum of the designer rewards $R_o$).\n",

    "At the same time, even if the reward is not identified, we can still mimic a good policy.\n",

    "The agent knows everything but $\\theta_*$.\n",
    "Can we learn it from demonstrations?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of unidentifiabilities in IRL: representational (should be ignored) and experimental (can be dealt with).\n",
    "The former relates to behavioural equivalence when we might have completely different rewards which lead to exactly the same behaviour for all the environments/tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimenter chooses an environment $E_t$ and a reward $R_t$.\n",
    "A human reveals $\\pi_t^*$ optimal for $R_t + \\theta_*$ in $E_t$.\n",
    "There is a theorem saying that if any task can be chosen, there is an algorithm that outputs $\\theta$, such that $||\\theta - \\theta_*||_\\infty \\leq \\epsilon$ after $O(\\log{(1/\\epsilon))}$ tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero-shot task generalization by learning to compose subtasks [35] is the next work the author reviews. \n",
    "The main motivation for the approach is in combinatorial complexity of composite policies which require us to do several subtasks. \n",
    "It is much easier to learn subtasks that all combinations of them (like in disentangled representation motivation).\n",
    "Let's assume we're in a grid world and can give our agent instruction using natural language.\n",

    "An RL algorithm does not usually work right after you implement it.\n",
    "You need to tweak it, you need to find better input representations, you need to try *a lot* and spend a lot of compute unless you find something satisfactory.\n",

    "An algorithm should guarantee that it will work on the first try with some degree of confidence (there is still a chance $\\delta$, that it will be worse than the current policy).\n",

    "* safe policy improvement (take only data $\\mathcal{D}$, probability $1-\\delta$ and output the policy of 'No solution found'.\n",

    "The optimal strategy is to bid the expected gain: $\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[gain] = \\text{price per click} * p(\\text{click})$ The click probability is called CTR.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about RL we think of multi-step episodes, in this talk, all the episodes have length one.\n",
    "The state is everything you know about the user, the amount we are willing to pay is the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we estimate the probability of a click? \n",
    "We have access to labelled data, where the information about the user is the input and click/no click is the label.\n",
    "The first thing that comes to mind, is to build a classifier.\n",
    "However, we can be smarter and use RL for that!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why should we do that?\n",
    "Implicitly we assume that our loss function is a good proxy for the revenue and that the input distribution is the same for training and testing data. \n",
    "These assumptions are tricky and not always hold in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the A/B testing: a two-arm bandit system.\n",
    "Split the population for some period of time and choose the system with the best average reward.\n",
    "It turns out, that RMSE is not that correlated with the return we can get and the lecturer shows that.\n",
    "People usually care about the optimum of the loss function. \n",
    "But it is often not the case. \n",
    "For instance, in this auction scenario, the competitors matter.\n",
    "Apart from the loss, we should ask ourselves: \"How much we are gonna pay if we take the wrong decision?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not that rosy regarding the input distribution as well.\n",
    "Our bidding policy influences the data we collect (*smells like RL here =)*). \n",
    "Moreover, we have the data only for the auctions we won, we don't know the CTR for all the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecturer points out that it's very easy to draw wrong conclusions from the data.\n",
    "He shows an example of the [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) next.\n",
    "Let's say, we need to understand where we want to show a banner: on top or on the side?\n",
    "We split the data into high-value and low-value users. \n",
    "Surprisingly, the conclusions for the overall dataset and for the two groups separately are entirely the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we do to deal with confounding variables and not to face the issue above:\n",
    "\n",
    "* add as many variables in the model (complicated)\n",
    "* run online a/b tests (what if you're a small company?)\n",
    "* exploration (model misspecification screws the things up and the authors has a demo for that)\n",
    "* perform counterfactual analyses (\"What would have happened if we had done something else?\" Would it have been better or worse?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance sampling allows us to evaluate Q:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G(q) = \\int_s \\int_a p(s) q(a|s) r(a,s)da\\,ds = \\int_s \\int_a p(s) \\frac{q(a|s)}{p(a|s)} p(a|s) r(a,s)da\\,ds \\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i{\\frac{q(a|s)}{p(a|s)}r_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We may now optimise over Q.\n",
    "However, we get additional constraints with this, i.e. rolling out a new policy is expensive and we need to optimise with as fewer updates as possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the benefits of policy evaluation in comparison to the supervised learning approach?\n",
    "The former turns out to be a better predictor working with tangible quantities. \n",
    "Constraint optimisation becomes meaningful here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In industry, it is very important to iterate and check your hypotheses fast and hassle-free ([Can you make a build in one step?](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/)). \n",
    "Policy optimisation is not that different: optimisations are performed regularly and must be trouble-free and robust. \n",
    "Stochastic methods are rarely trouble-free (e.g. hyperparameter optimisation is tricky).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the lecture, Nicolas mentions some of the questions important for real-life applications, namely, how to reduce the inference time and how to combine the rewards of multiple forms (clicks, sales etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up:\n",
    "\n",
    "* robustness and efficiency are critical\n",
    "* pipeline efficiency included there\n",
    "* improving the model is useless without a good reward (*evaluation, I would say*)\n",
    "* RL deals with tangible quantities (e.g. dollars instead of log-loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite an interesting lecture, especially if you never had industry experience. \n",
    "Apart from that, it's also curious to observe a use-case when RL is applied in practice, which is still rare. \n",
    "Surprisingly for me, Nicolas says that evaluation is underrated in industry.\n",
    "That's especially curious in the light of the latest evaluation work in RL.\n",
    "That means, that there is huge room and need for improvement here.\n",
    "This lecture intersects a bit with the previous one on safe RL when we discussed off-policy evaluation."

    "\n",
    "This lecture is the not as much on RL as on Visual Dialogues. \n",
    "However it is quite interesting in terms of reframing a problem so that it begin to look like an RL problem.\n",
    "In the first part Devi Parikh introduces us to the domain.\n",
    "In the second part Dhruv Batra shows how we can use RL knowledge to advance in the Visual Dialogue problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It all starts as captioning. \n",
    "A model tries to describe the content of a picture.\n",
    "Next, a human asks question, and this is Visual Question Answering (VQA).\n",
    "The power mode is when we want to have a dialog – a sequence of VQAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need to describe images with words? \n",
    "\n",
    "Lot's of applications:\n",
    "* assistance for visually-impaired users\n",
    "* helping visually-impaired analysis (e.g. going through surveillance videos)\n",
    "* natural language instructions for robots\n",
    "\n",
    "VQA is hard since it requires a lot of things from you:\n",
    "* recognising even small objects in the scene\n",
    "* count them\n",
    "* have some background knowledge (e.g. meat is not a vegetarian meal)\n",
    "* reason out of context (moustache of banana)\n",
    "\n",
    "Language priors are extremely strong.\n",
    "Often model success is not AGI, but a coincidence because of an imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "For instance, a giraffe is often standing next to trees. And a model just needs to recognise a giraffe and complete the second part automatically ('standing next to a tree')\n",
    "'Do you see...' or 'Is there...' questions are also prone to error in the evaluation protocol because of the same error.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration of this fact, balancing the VQA dataset [41] leads to 7-8% performance drop for VQA models. \n",
    "However, after retraining on the balanced one, the models regain 1-2% in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to go deeper, to the Visual Dialog, we need a dataset. \n",
    "We have one [42], collected via Amazon Turk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Visual Dialog evaluation protocol is the following:\n",
    "* an image $I$\n",
    "* history $(Q_1,A_1),...(Q_{t-1},A_{t-1})$\n",
    "* follow up question $Q_t$\n",
    "* 100 answer options (50 answers from NN questions, 30 popular, 20 random)\n",
    "* Rank the list of 100 options\n",
    "* Accuracy/Error mean-rank-of-GT, mean reciprocal rank\n",
    "\n",
    "Open directions:\n",
    "• Improve dialog agents via self-talk (smells like RL already);\n",
    "• Domain adaptation via self-talk (smells like RL already);\n",
    "• Dialog rollouts, future prediction, theory of mind;\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part ends here, and we are slowly approaching the RL part.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are existing problems in Visual Dialogue:\n",
    "* conversation has no goal\n",
    "* agent not in control of the dialogue (e.g. doesn’t get to see its errors during training)\n",
    "* Learning equivalent utterances (there are many equivalent questions/answers, but we do not learn them)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's play a game.\n",
    "There are two bots: Q-bot and A-bot. \n",
    "The former asks question about some picture, the latter answers them.\n",
    "They have to cooperate (the reward is shared), so that after 10 rounds of conversations Q-bot guesses what picture it is.\n",
    "They models have no shared parameters so that there is no leakage (Q-bot must not see the pic!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The actions for Q-bot is $q_t$ (a question) and image regression $\\hat{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4096}$.\n",
    "A-bot's actions are just answers $a_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q-bot's state $s_t^Q$ is $[c, q1, a1, ... q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}]$.\n",
    "A-bot's state $s_t^A$ is $[I, c, q1, a1, ....q_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, q_t]$, $c$ are the captions, as far as I get. The captions are generated by A-bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward is design to answer the question \"Did Q-bot's question helped or not?\": $r_t(s_t^Q, (q_t, a_t, y_t)) = l(\\hat{y}_{t-1}, y^{gt}) - l(\\hat{y}_{t}, y^{gt})$, where $l$ is the distance between image embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanilla REINFORCE does the trick and gets quite a jump in performance in comparison to just supervised learning.\n",
    "Voilà.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the talk, the lecturer quickly covers some of the going on research and provides a list of relevant papers [43, 44, 45, 46, 47].\n",
    "\n",
    "I first thought that the lecture was not from RLSS but DLSS since there is very little on RL here.\n",
    "Hovewer, it turned out pretty interesting in terms of domain and ability to reframe a problem so that you can apply a new approach to an old challenge."
