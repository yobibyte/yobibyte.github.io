    "[ICLR 2016](http://www.iclr.cc/doku.php?id=iclr2016:main#accepted_papers_conference_track) has a really interesting [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06422) \"All You Need is a Good Init\". In this post I will try to repeat the results of the authors and will do that in Torch.\n",
    "## General idea\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is the motivation? [Batch Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) helps, but it slows down the training process (the authors claim it's 30%). Can we do better without additional overhead?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we can spend more time for smart weights initialization (not much more), but get benefits in training speed, ability to use bigger learning rates and better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` pseudo\n",
    "Pre-initialize network with orthonormal matrices as in Saxe et al.(2014)\n",

    "What I found important for the implementation here:\n",
    "- L is a Convolutional or Fully Connected layer\n",
    "- For each layer we use a new minibatch.\n",
    "- We compute variance for the whole data in minibatch: Var(B_L)! (at first I thought that we compute variance feature-wise)\n",

    "I did not wait for 100 epochs as the authors of the original paper did. At first, I thought that we can use bigger learning rates when we use LSUV, but then I realised that MNIST nolsuv case does not use BN, so, this is not true. And MNIST results just show us that training works and the accuracy rates are pretty comparable. Let's have a look at CIFAR-10 experiment.\n",

    "I did not check the limit of the accuracy we can achieve, but just checked if the training is comparable in general. And it is. Test dataset accuracy is on the pic.\n",
