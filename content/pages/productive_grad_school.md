Title: Productive Grad School

I've just started my PhD. 
You've probably just started yours.
I'll put some links below which might make our life easier a bit by learning from the people who've been there already.
However, some links are quite generic, the list is mostly biased towards computer science/engineering/math.

Have a link? Please, share it with [me](vitaliykurin@gmail.com).
