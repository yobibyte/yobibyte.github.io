I am a research scientist at Isomorphic Labs working on AI-first drug discovery. Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the University of Oxford working on multitask reinforcement learning with graph-based state-action representation. My scientific advisor is Shimon Whiteson. I'm also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/y0b1byte">yobibyte</a>. <p><a href="mailto:vitaliykurin@gmail.com">Ping me</a></p> if you are interested in my work.
