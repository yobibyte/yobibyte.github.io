<h1>Advent of terminal</h1>

<p>
I always wanted to teach my son how to use terminal.
I believe this shows how incredibly powerful and automatable our computers can be.
I came up with this idea similar to the Advent of Code, and also inspired by CtF competitions where you are looking for a clue in a system.
</p>
<p>
Every day, I give him a terminal window opened in a folder that has a puzzle.
He has to find an answer.
I give minumal number of instructions and only rarely help him with ideas, he has to google stuff himself.
You can find the puzzles below.
<p>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>You start in a directory that has <tt>answer.txt</tt>. You have to learn <tt>ls/cat</tt> to find and read the solution.</p>

<h2> Day 2 </h2>
<p>
You start in a directory that has <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt> directories. Those directories also have two directories each. After a several layers, one of the leaf directories has <tt>answer.txt</tt>. You have to practice your <tt>cd</tt> skills to find the clue.
You can also do <tt>find</tt> or <tt>tree</tt>, but this is a bit more involved.
</p>

<h2> Day 3 </h2>
<p>
<tt>answer.txt</tt> has more than 1000 lines in it. The first line says: "The answer to this challenge is the number of lines in this file".
You need to use <tt>wc -l</tt> to get it.
</p>
<h2> Day 4 </h2>
<p>
You start in a directory that has <tt>answer.txt</tt>, but this file was <tt>chmodded</tt> with <tt>000</tt> mask. You will have to learn how to add read rights to the file to get the clue.
</p>
<h2> Day 5 </h2>
<p>
<tt>answer.txt</tt> has more than 1000 lines in it. The first line says: "The answer to this puzzle is this file size in kilobytes.". You need to learn <tt>ls</tt> flags for this.
</p>
<h2> Day 6 </h2>
<p>
The starting directory has five files of different size: <tt>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</tt>. File <tt>1</tt> says that the answer to this puzzle is a 5 digit number that you get if you sort the files by their filesize from smallest to largest.
</p>
<h2> Day 7 </h2>
<p>
The starting directory has two files in it. The first line says: "The answer to this challenge is a number which is present in one file, but not in another. You need to compare the two somehow. Difference is key!" The rest of the file is 999 numbers in one file, and 998 numbers in another.
</p>
<h2> Day 8 </h2>
<p>
<tt>answer.txt</tt> says: "The answer to this challenge is the number of lines in the source code of my website: https://yobibyte.github.io/. You might find <tt>wget</tt> command useful for that.
</p>
<h2> Day 9 </h2>
<p>
This is an important day. You have to open <tt>answer.txt</tt> in <tt>vim</tt> and quit it to finish the challenge.
If you opened <tt>vim</tt>, but cannot quit it, it does not count.
Good luck!
</p>
<h2> Day 10</h2>
<p>
This time, <tt>answer.txt</tt> has more than a thousand lines in it. The first line says: "You can find the answer by looking through this file. But you have to be smart about it. Have you heard of grep?". One of the lines says: "the answer to this puzzle is ..."
</p>

<h2> Day 11</h2>
<p>
The starting directory has <tt>answer.tar.gz</tt>. The archive has <tt>answer.txt</tt> in it. You need to learn how to unarchive it to get the clue.
