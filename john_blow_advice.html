<h1>Jonathan Blow on how to deal with mental health issues</h1>

I really loved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7kh8pNRWOo">this video</a>, where Jonathan Blow shares some techniques he uses to deal with lack of motivation and depression.
I wish I saw this when I was a PhD student, I think there is a lot of useful techniques in there.
