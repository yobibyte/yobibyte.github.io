<title>Welcome to yobihome</title>

I switched to Neovim reasonably recently, and absolutely love it.
I have always had problems with the vim plugins setup, but with with Neovime and Lazy, I have never had any issues.
It is extremely easy to use, and easy to get started with.

Initially, I started with <a href="https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim">kickstart.nvim</a>, and started trimming it down to reduce the number of dependencies and keep only the necessary stuff.
In this page, I am listing my plugins, briefly describing why I need each of them.
If you want to see my <tt>init.lua</tt>, you can find it <a href="https://github.com/yobibyte/yobitools/blob/main/dotfiles/init.lua">here</a>.


<h2><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a></h2>
Dealing with git.
I usually do everything in command line, apart from staging hunks.
I really like pressing :G and being able to unfold/fold each of the files, interactively stage hunks, and commit only what I need.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth">vim-sleuth</a></h2>
Another great plugin from the same guy (tpope).
This one automatically adjusts shiftwidth/expandtab based on the file/directory content.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/mbbill/undotree">undootree</a></h2>
This plugin saves your edit history in a tree-like way.
You will never lose any changes by doing undo/redo, and can visually see your the diffs.


<h2><a href="https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig">nvim-lspconfig</a></h2>
Configurations for all supported LSP servers.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp">nvim-cmp</a></h2>
Completion engine that becomes really powerful when used together with LSP.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim">gitsigns</a></h2>
Show git markers on the sign column, e.g. if the line was added.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim">nigthfox</a></h2>
High-quality and beautiful theme. I'm using <tt>nordfox</tt> colorscheme.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim">comment</a></h2>
Always struggled with multiline comments in vim?
This plugin is for you.
<tt>gcc</tt> comments a line you are on.
<tt>gcj</tt> comments a line you are on and the one below.
<tt>gc2j</tt> comments a line you are on and the two below.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim">telescope</a></h2>
Great fuzzy finder interface for neovim.
I use it for everything: quickly navigating in the codebase, look for references, look for file/class structure, search over code warnings.
This is one of my favourite plugins.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim">telescope-fzf-native</a></h2>
Native fzf implementation to improve the performance of telescope.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim">aerial</a></h2>
This enables looking at the file/class structure in a telescope window.
<h2><a href="https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter">treesitter</a></h2>
Syntax highlighting and quick code selection (e.g. quickly select a whole function).
<h2><a href="https://github.com/danymat/neogen">neogen</a></h2>
I use this one to generate a template for docstrings with a press of a shortcut.
