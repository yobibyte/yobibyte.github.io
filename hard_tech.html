<h1>hard tech is the way to go</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeAMiBKi_EM">Software is in decline</a>. It gets slower faster than hardware gets faster (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law">known as Wirth's law</a>). Moreover, software is in decline purpose-wise. We get hooked on software that makes us spend more and more time on it, makes us less focused, and more miserable.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, tech is often associated with software described above, and is, rightfully, hated. At the same time, we live in the future, where we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_gene_synthesis">DNA printers</a>, can have a look at COVID <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">vaccine code</a> online, and can bring back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship">rockets that have been to space</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The stuff I described in the paragraph above does not grow on trees.
It's a result of overcoming hard scientific and engineering challenges done by a bunch of people organised together, known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_tech">hard tech</a>.
It seems to me, that working for a hard tech company is considered to be less prestigious for a CS department graduate.
Starting a hard tech startup is also harder (pun intended) as it needs more time and money to do basic research.
</p>

<p>
I think this is unfortunate as hard tech companies provide a whole bunch of benefits that pure digital startups usually lack:
<ul>
  <li>Clear purpose with an obvious value to the society: you are problem-first, there's no BS, and you can use any available methods to solve your problem. If you solve the problem, the humanity benefits from it.</li>
  <li>Bringing the future you would like your children to live in: do you want your children to do cross-planetary travel? Do you want them doomscroll three hours a day?</li>
  <li>Working in cross-disciplinary teams: you not only learn a bunch of interesting stuff, but you can build something none of the communities can build alone. We see a lot of exciting stuff in the AI for science research these days.</li>
</ul>
</p>

I hope that the text above resonated with you, and you consider switching to the dark side, we have lots of problems to solve.
