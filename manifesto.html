<h1>Shit Non-Proliferation Manifesto</h1>
<p><i>Originally published in 2017</i></p>

<p>The amount of information we percieve every day is enormous. We get up in the
morning and start scrolling facebook, checking the mailbox, tweeting about the
acne on our buttock or about the information overload. We open youtube and 
start watching something unimportant while we brush our teeth.</p>
<p>The rest of the day looks exactly the same. We read mass media that is full of 
news like 'A nude woman stole food from her neighbour's dog', 'A 4-year old boy 
ate his grandfathers' socks'. This is how mass media rolls. This is how they 
attract new readers. This is the kind of information we want to show our friends.</p>
<p>Yeah, I forgot to mention, each time we see something funny, stupid or 
"interesting", we press 'share' button and make our friends look at that shit. 
And we laugh at how stupid people are on these videos, pictures, memes or other 
stuff. We are proud to be smarter than heroes of our shared material. The 
stupidity of the world makes us feel sad.</p>
<p>But wait? Don't we take part in making the world dumber? Don't we make our
friends lose time instead of doing something great? Won't it be better to make
ourselves smarter than just make fun of others' stupidity? Oh, boy! We make the
situation worse. That is the reason why I write this manifesto. That is what I
want you to do next time when you press the 'share' button: think if it is 
another piece of shit or not. Please, do not take part in the shit 
proliferation.</p>
<p>And this is our <b>manifesto</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt">Information is power</a>. 
But not all the information as well as power makes us stronger.</li>
<li>We do not want to spend the whole life reading shit, watching shit and
listening to shit.</li>
<li>We do not want our friends to do that either. And moreover We do not want them
to make me do that.</li>
<li>We want make this world smarter</li>
<li>Thus, since now, every time we want to share something with our friends, we 
think if they really need this.</li>
</ul>
<p align='center'>Will you join us?</p>
